Methods         array{object, dict} GetPCMs()

                        Returns the array of available PCM objects and
                        associated properties.

Signals         void PCMAdded(object path, dict props)

                        Signal emitted when new PCM is added. It contains
                        the object path and associated properties.

                void PCMRemoved(object path)

                        Signal emitted when device has been removed. The
                        object path is only for a reference - it has been
                        already removed.

Methods         fd, fd Open()

                        Open BlueALSA PCM stream. This method returns two file
                        descriptors, respectively PCM stream PIPE and PCM
                        controller SEQPACKET socket.

                        Controller socket commands: "Drain", "Drop", "Pause",
                                                    "Resume"

                void SelectCodec(uint16 codec, dict props)

                        Select PCM codec. This call shall be made before PCM
                        stream opening for given transport type, otherwise the
                        ongoing stream (or PCM counterpart: sink, source) will
                        be terminated.

Properties      object Device [readonly]

                        BlueZ device object path.

                string Transport [readonly]

                        Underlying Bluetooth transport type.

                        Possible values: "A2DP-sink", "A2DP-source", "HFP-AG",
                                         "HFP-HF", "HSP-AG" or "HSP-HS"

                string Mode [readonly]

                        PCM stream operation mode (direction).

                        Possible values: "sink" or "source"

                uint16 Format [readonly]

                        Stream format identifier. The highest two bits of the
                        16-bit identifier determine the signedness and the
                        endianness, where the remaining bits are used to store
                        the bit-width.

                        Examples: 0x4010 - unsigned 16-bit big-endian
                                  0x8018 - signed 24-bit little-endian

                byte Channels [readonly]

                        Number of audio channels.

                uint32 Sampling [readonly]

                        Sampling frequency.

                uint16 Codec [readonly]

                        Bluetooth transport codec. The meaning of this value
                        depends on the Bluetooth transport type.

                uint16 Delay [readonly]

                        Approximate PCM delay in 1/10 of millisecond.

                uint16 Volume [readwrite]

                        This property holds PCM volume and mute information
                        for channel 1 (left) and 2 (right). Data for channel
                        1 is stored in the upper byte, while channel 2 is
                        stored in the lower byte. The highest bit of both
                        bytes determines whether channel is muted.

                        Possible A2DP values: 0-127
                        Possible SCO values: 0-15

Object path     [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX/rfcomm

Methods         fd Open()

                        Open RFCOMM socket for dispatching AT commands not
                        handled internally by BlueALSA. This method returns
                        a SEQPACKET socket.

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.NotSupported
                                         dbus.Error.Failed

Properties      string Transport [readonly]

                        HFP/HSP transport type.

                        Possible values: "HFP-AG", "HFP-HF", "HSP-AG" or
                                         "HSP-HS"

                uint32 Features [readonly]

                        HFP feature bitmask. Note, that this value depends on
                        the connection mode.

                byte Battery [readonly]

                        Remote device battery level.

                        Possible values: 0-100 or -1
